# bdfr-html
Converts the output of the [bulk downloader for reddit (V2)](https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit)  to a set of HTML pages. 

Currently requires that you run both the archive and the download portions of the BDfR bulk downloader script and that the names of the downloaded files contain the post id (this is default).
Currently only supports the json version of the archive output from BDfR V2. 

**Usage**

`python3 bdfrToHTML.py --input ./location/of/archive/and/downloads --output /../html/`

**Docker-Compose**

For ease of use for both bdfr and bdfr-html in an automated fashion, I have included a docker-compose file which will spin up both an automation container and a web server container. The automation container will run bdfr and then subsequently bdfr-html, producing a volume or mounted folder containing the generated html files. The web server container shares the output volume and hosts the generated files. Currently this is tasked to only save "Saved" user content, however this might be changed in the future. If you would prefer to populate bdfr-html with your own reddit json/media files from bdfr, you can use a similar docker-compose file, but mount the folder where you have saved your content to the `BDFR_IN` folder (/input by default). 

For the time being, you will need to authenticate bdfr by either putting a copy of your config file into the mounted config folder or browsing to the links generated by bdfr which will be found in the container log files and running `docker exec -it bdfr-html wget "[insert resulting url here]"` with a copy of the resulting auth url. 

**Additional Features**

- Use the --archive_context option to pull the related contextual post for downloaded comments (requires BDfR in the same folder).
- Use the --recover_comments option to have the script attempt to pull deleted comments from Pushshift. 

**Planned Features**

- Using Pushshift to pull deleted post contents 
- Adding an optional archiver to archive webpages linked in posts
- Possible static-site generation
